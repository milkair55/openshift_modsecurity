UPGRADING: IMPORTANT NOTE

Upgrading from 3.0 or any earlier version, you may need to:
  (1) Load mod_xml2enc
  (2) Use the new "ProxyHTMLEnable On" directive in place of
      Apache's general-purpose filter configuration (such as
      SetOutputFilter or FilterChain).
Without these it'll work fine with ASCII or Unicode utf-8,
but is likely to display characters incorrectly with other
character encodings.

If you are upgrading from mod_proxy_html 2.x (or 1.x), you will need
to configure what HTML elements should be treated as links and events.
The configuration file "proxy_html.conf" loaded into your httpd.conf
(or apache.conf, apache2.conf or similar according to packager's whims)
does this if you're dealing with standard/W3C HTML 4 and/or XHTML 1.

WINDOWS USERS:

You may need to install some prerequisite libraries before you can
load mod_proxy_html into apache.  If you don't already have them,
see the README at
	http://apache.webthing.com/mod_proxy_html/windows/
